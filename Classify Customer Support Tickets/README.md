## Classify Customer Support Tickets

In this project I built a model to classify support tickets using Natural Language Processing and a Multinomial Naive Bayes model.

#### Language:
- Python

#### Librairies used in this project:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- sklearn

#### Data:
For this project I used Microsoft's anonymised support ticket dataset, available for download [here](https://github.com/vat3300/SSMA-Smart-Service-Management-Assistent-/blob/main/all_tickets.csv).

#### Outcome:
Our model can classify tickets with high accuracy but only based on the first column "ticket_type". With the creation of other models to classify the other columns, it would be possible to automate completely the process of ticket classification.
