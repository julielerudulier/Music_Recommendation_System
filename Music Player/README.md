## Music Player

In this project, I created a music player using Pygame and Tkinter. I decided to try and create an MP3 Player with Python after reading an interesting article on [Data Flair's blog](https://data-flair.training/). It gave me the opportunity to learn more about Tkinter, which I definitely want to use in other future projects!

#### Language used in this project:
- Python

#### Librairies:
- Pygame
- Tkinter


Here are some screenshots of the music player:
