## Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification

In this project I analysed machine maintenance data to understand the underlying causes and patterns of equipment failures. Based on the data and my observations, I was able to build an effective maintenance prediction model.

#### Language:
- Python

#### Librairies used in this project:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Smotenc
- Sklearn
- Pipeline

#### Data:
For this project I used a Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification dataset, which provides a comprehensive collection of sensor data from industrial equipment and offers insights into operational conditions and potential failure indicators. The dataset consists of 10,000 data points, and is available for download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification).

#### Outcome:
Considering that this problem is a multiclass classification problem with unbalanced data, I was able to build a model with an overall accuracy of 98%.
