## Music Recommendation System

This was my final project for the **Data Analyst Certificate** I obtained from L'Ã©cole des **Mines Paris PSL** in August 2023. Although the substance of the project deals more with Machine Learning and unsupervised learning algorithms, a large part of the project had to do with data analysis and cleansing.

The aim of this project was to build a music recommendation system based on data retrieved from Spotify and Twitter.
I chose to group similar tracks automatically by running a k-means algorithm on the dataset, but I was not very successful in creating self-sufficient clusters. I was still able to use the clusters by adding manual steps and fine-tuning my function to create the first part of the recommendation system."


The second part of the algorithm was based on a similarity matrix. Using the Mahalanobis metric allowed my function to return the best recommendations possible, given the limited number of songs avaible in our dataset."


I started working on this project in January 2023. A paper on data cleansing and exploration was first handed in to Faculty members in March. This paper also included data visualizations and a primary analysis of trends in data. A second paper on data modeling was handed in in May. The final essay was handed in to Faculty members in June, while the outcomes of this project as well as the recommendation system were presented to a jury on June 26th, 2023.
