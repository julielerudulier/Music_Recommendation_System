## Spaceship Titanic

In this project, I built a model to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly.

#### Language:
- Python

#### Librairies used in this project:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy Stats

#### Data:
For this project I used Kaggle's Spaceship Titanic dataset, which consists of a set of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system. The dataset is available for download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic).

#### Outcome:
I was able to build models that performed reasonably well on the dataset, as the highest accuracy of all the models built is 0.802.
