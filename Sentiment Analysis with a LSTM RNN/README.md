## Sentiment Analysis

In this project, I built a Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network model using Keras and TensorFlow to perform a sentiment analysis on an IMDB's dataset.

#### Language:
- Python

#### Librairies used in this project:
- Keras

#### Data:
For this project I used the IMDB movie review sentiment classification dataset. This contains 25,000 movie reviews from the IMDB website which have been labeled with their sentiment (positive or negative).

#### Outcome:
I was able to build a model with an overall accuracy of 0.8282 and a loss of 0.8537 on the first attempt.
