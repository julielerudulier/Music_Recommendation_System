## Stock Price Forecast

In this project, I built two stock price forecast models: a KNN model and a Random Forest model.

#### Language:
- Python

#### Librairies used in this project:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Yfinance
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly
- Keras (Sequential, Dense)

#### Data:
For this project, I used the Yahoo Finance API through the yfinance library and fetched historical stock data for various companies. 

#### Outcome:
I was able to build a KNN model which performed rather well with a Mean Absolute Error of 5.7, while the Random Forest model had a Mean Absolute Error of 11.2.
