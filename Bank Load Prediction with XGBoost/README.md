Performance of the base learners were already very high, with the Decision Tree model getting an accuracy score of 0.9880. But if we look at the precision scores for instance, the meta learner still has a positive effect with an overall precision of 0.9890 for the customers without a loan, and 0.9773 for those who do have a loan.

We can thus conclude that even though one of the base learners had exceptional results, we were able to get even better scores with the meta learner.
