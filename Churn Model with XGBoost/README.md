We get back an accuracy score of 97.6% on the test dataset, with an AUC score of 0.92. The tuned model is performing better than the untuned model and we are now able to predict with very high accuracy which of customers are going to churn and which will be retained, purely based on their tenure, call plan, call charges and usage, and how often they needed to contact customer service.
