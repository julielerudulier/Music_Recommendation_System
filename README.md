# Programming Projects
This repository contains some of the projects I've worked on throughout the past few months to become more efficient as a Data Scientist, working with a variety of different Python librairies as well as SQL.

Here is the list of projects presented in this folder:

  - **1 - Causes of Customer Churn with CoxPHFitter:** In this project, I used Cox’s Proportional Hazards model to examine a contractual churn dataset to quickly identify the factors associated with the loss of customers.
    - Language: Python
    - Librairies: Pandas, Numpy, CoxPHFitter, Matplotlib
    
  - **2 - Churn Model with XGBoost:** In this project, I built a customer retention model (or churn model) for a contractual setting and aimed to predict which customers were retained and which would be most likely to churn based on the experience they’ve had as customers of a phone provider.
    - Language: Python
    - Librairies: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Optuna
 
  - **3 - Classify Customer Support Tickets with a Multinomial Naive Bayes model:** In this project, I built a model to classify support tickets using Natural Language Processing and a Multinomial Naive Bayes model.
    - Language: Python
    - Librairies: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn

  - **4 - Machine Predictive Maintenance with multiple classifiers:** In this project, I analysed machine maintenance data to understand the underlying causes and patterns of equipment failures. Based on the data and my observations, I was able to build an effective maintenance prediction model.
    - Language: Python
    - Librairies: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Express, Imblearn (SMOTENC, Pipeline), Scikit-learn

  - **5 - Music Battles, a web application:** This is my final project for Harvard's CS50 program. It’s a web application where music artists compete with each other on a musical level.
    - Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
    - Framework and engine: Flask, Jinja
    - Librairies: Pandas, Numpy

  - **6 - Music Player with Pygame and Tkinter:** In this project, I created a music player using PyGame and Tkinter.
    - Language: Python
    - Librairies: Pygame, Tkinter
 
  - **7 - Music Recommendation System with Kmeans:** This is my final project for the Data Analyst Certificate I obtained from L'école des Mines Paris PSL in August 2023. It was my FIRST coding project ever!
    - Language: Python
    - Framework: Streamlit
    - Librairies: Scikit-learn, Yellowbrick, Pandas, Numpy, Requests, Json, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Graphviz, Plotly Express
 
  - **8 - Short Coding Problems:** In this folder are short basic-level coding problems that I solved with Python and SQL. I often use them to practice my programming skills and analytical aptitude, and make sure I know how to solve these problems quickly but efficiently.
