# Programming Projects
This repository contains some of the projects I've worked on throughout the past few months to become more efficient as a Data Scientist, working with a variety of different Python librairies as well as SQL.

Here is the list of projects presented in this folder:

  - **1 - Bank Loan Demand Prediction with XGBoost:** In this project, I used meta learner XGBoost to enhance the performance of two basic learners (Linear Regression and Decision Tree) to predict which customers would be most like to get a bank loan.
    - Language: Python
    - Librairies: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost <br /> <br />

  - **2 - Causes of Customer Churn with CoxPHFitter:** In this project, I used Cox’s Proportional Hazards model to examine a contractual churn dataset to quickly identify the factors associated with the loss of customers.
    - Language: Python
    - Librairies: Pandas, Numpy, CoxPHFitter, Matplotlib 
    - Model: CoxPHFitter <br /> <br />
    
  - **3 - Churn Model with XGBoost:** In this project, I built a customer retention model (or churn model) for a contractual setting and aimed to predict which customers were retained and which would be most likely to churn based on the experience they’ve had as customers of a phone provider.
    - Language: Python
    - Librairies: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Optuna
    - Model: XGBoost <br /> <br />
 
  - **4 - Classify Customer Support Tickets with a Multinomial Naive Bayes model:** In this project, I built a model to classify support tickets using Natural Language Processing and a Multinomial Naive Bayes model.
    - Language: Python
    - Librairies: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn
    - Model: Multinomial Naive Bayes <br /> <br />

  - **5 - Credit Card Fraud Detection using SMOTE:** In this project, I built various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud.
    - Language: Python
    - Librairies: Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow, Keras, Imbalanced-learn, Scikit-learn, SciPy Stats, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Itertools, Time, Collections
    - Models: Logistic Regression, KNears Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier, SMOTE
  
  -  **6 - Infer the effects of marketing with CausalImpact:** In this project, I used Google's CausalImpact to try identify whether a marketing campaign/action had a statistically significant impact on a chosen metric.
    - Language: Python
    - Librairies: Pandas, Causalimpact <br /> <br />
  
  - **7 - House Prices Prediction using TensorFlow Decision Forests:** In this project, I trained a baseline Random Forest model using TensorFlow Decision Forests to predict House Prices.
    - Language: Python
    - Librairies: Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow, Tensorflow Decision Forests, Seaborn, Matplotlib <br /> <br />

  - **8 - Machine Predictive Maintenance with multiple classifiers:** In this project, I analysed machine maintenance data to understand the underlying causes and patterns of equipment failures. Based on the data and my observations, I was able to build an effective maintenance prediction model.
    - Language: Python
    - Librairies: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Express, Imblearn (SMOTENC, Pipeline), Scikit-learn
    - Models: PCA + RandomForest, Gradient Boosting, SMOTENC <br /> <br />

  - **9 - Music Battles, a web application:** This is my final project for Harvard's CS50 program. It’s a web application where music artists compete with each other on a musical level.
    - Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
    - Framework and engine: Flask, Jinja
    - Librairies: Pandas, Numpy <br /> <br />

  - **10 - Music Player with Pygame and Tkinter:** In this project, I created a music player using PyGame and Tkinter.
    - Language: Python
    - Librairies: Pygame, Tkinter <br /> <br />
 
  - **11 - Music Recommendation System with Kmeans:** This is my final project for the Data Analyst Certificate I obtained from L'école des Mines Paris PSL in August 2023. It was my FIRST coding project ever!
    - Language: Python
    - Framework: Streamlit
    - Librairies: Scikit-learn, Yellowbrick, Pandas, Numpy, Requests, Json, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Graphviz, Plotly Express
    - Model: PCA, Kmeans, Similarity Matrix <br /> <br />

  - **12 - Sentiment Analysis:** In this project, I built a Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network model using Keras and TensorFlow to perform a sentiment analysis on an IMDB's dataset.
   - Langugage: Python
   - Librairy: Keras <br /> <br />
  
  - **13 - Short Coding Problems:** In this folder are short basic-level coding problems that I solved with Python and SQL. I often use them to practice my programming skills and analytical aptitude, and make sure I know how to solve these problems quickly but efficiently. <br /> <br />

  - **14 - Smartphones Data Exploration:** In this project, I conducted a data exploration to discover meaningful patterns, insights, and relationships between features of smartphones.
    - Language: Python
    - Librairies: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib Pyplot, Seaborn, Wordcloud, Datetime, SciPy, IPython Display, Collect <br /> <br />

  - **15 - Spaceship Titanic:** In this project, I built a model to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly.
    - Language: Python
    - Librairies: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, SciPy Stats
    - Model: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, GridSearch CV, Random Forest, Randomized Search CV <br /> <br />
