# Programming Projects
This repository contains some of the projects I've worked on throughout the past few months to become more efficient as a Data Scientist, working with a variety of different Python librairies as well as SQL.

Here is the list of projects presented in this folder:

- **Causes of Customer Churn:** In this project, I used Cox’s Proportional Hazards model to examine a contractual churn dataset to quickly identify the factors associated with the loss of customers.
  - Language: Python
  - Librairies: Pandas, Numpy, CoxPHFitter, Matplotlib
    
- **Churn Model with XGBoost:** In this project, I built a customer retention model (or churn model) for a contractual setting and aimed to predict which customers were retained and which would be most likely to churn based on the experience they’ve had as customers of a phone provider.
  - Language: Python
  - Librairies: Sklearn, XGBoost, Optuna
 
- **Music Battles:** This is my final project for Harvard's CS50 program. It’s a web application where music artists compete with each other on a musical level.
  - Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
  - Framework and engine: Flask, Jinja
  - Librairies: Pandas, Numpy

- **Music Player:** In this project, I created a music player using PyGame and Tkinter.
  - Language: Python
  - Librairies: Pygame, Tkinter
 
- **Music Recommendation System:** This is my final project for the Data Analyst Certificate I obtained from L'école des Mines Paris PSL in August 2023. It was my FIRST coding project ever!
  - Language: Python
  - Framework: Streamlit
  - Librairies: Sklearn, Yellowbrick, Pandas, Numpy, Requests, Json, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Graphviz, Plotly Express
 
- **Short Coding Problems:** In this folder are short basic-level coding problems that I solved with Python and SQL. I often use them to practice my programming skills and analytical aptitude, and make sure I know how to solve these problems quickly but efficiently.
