## House Prices Prediction

In this project, I followed in [Gus Martin](https://linktr.ee/gusthema)'s footsteps and trained a baseline Random Forest model using TensorFlow Decision Forests to predict House Prices. 

#### Language:
- Python

#### Librairies used in this project:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Tensorflow
- Tensorflow Decision Forests
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

#### Data:
For this project I used Kaggle's House Prices datasets avaible for download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

#### Outcome:
I was able to build a model with high accuracy: The Mean Square Error for this model equals 0, indicating that the expected and actual values match precisely.
