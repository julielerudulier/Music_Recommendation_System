## Short Coding Problems

In this folder are short basic-level coding problems that I solved with Python and SQL. I often use them to practice my programming skills and analytical aptitude, and make sure I know how to solve these problems quickly but efficiently.

#### List of problems:

- factorial: this program calculates the factorial of a number provided by user input, using recursion (Python);
- largest_squared: this program finds the square of the largest element in an array (Python);
- is_prime: this program finds whether a number is a prime number or not (Python);
- delete_duplicates: this program deletes duplicates and returns a list without duplicates, sorted by descending order (Python);
- second_largest_number: this program finds the second-largest number in a list (Python);
- reverse_words: this program reverses the order of words in a sentence (Python);
- count_case_characters: this program counts the lower and upper case characters in a given text (Python);
- n_prime_numbers: for a given number n, this program returns the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than n (Python);
- customers_analysis: based on a given database, this program returns specific information about customers and revenues.
